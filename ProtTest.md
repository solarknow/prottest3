# `ProtTest 3` #

## A high performance computing application for selection of best-fit models of protein evolution ##

## What can I use `ProtTest` for? â€“ Introduction ##

`ProtTest` is a bioinformatic tool for the selection of best-fit models of aminoacid replacement for the data at hand. `ProtTest` makes this selection by finding the model in the candidate list with the smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score or Decision Theory Criterion (DT). At the same time, `ProtTest` obtains model-averaged estimates of different parameters (including a model-averaged phylogenetic tree) and calculates their importance(Posada and Buckley 2004). `ProtTest` differs from its nucleotide analog jModeltest (Darriba et.al 2012) in that it does not include likelihood ratio tests, as not all models included in `ProtTest` are nested.

`ProtTest` is written in Java and uses the program [PhyML](http://code.google.com/p/phyml) (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of phylogenetic trees and model parameters. The current version of `ProtTest` (3.2) includes 15 different rate matrices that result in 120 different models when we consider rate variation among sites (+I: invariable sites; +G: gamma-distributed rates) and the observed amino acid frequencies (+F).
